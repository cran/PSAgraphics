\title{Data on 996 initial Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCIs) performed in 1997 at
the Lindner Center, Christ Hospital, Cincinnati.}
\description{
  Data from an observational study of 996 patients receiving a PCI at Ohio Heart
Health in 1997 and followed for at least 6 months by the staff of the Lindner Center.
This is a landmark dataset in the literature on propensity score adjustment for
treatment selection bias due to practice of evidence based medicine; patients receiving
abciximab tended to be more severely diseased than those who did not receive a IIb/IIIa
cascade blocker.

\usage{data(lindner)}
\format{A data frame with 996 observations on the following 10 variables, no NAs.
\describe{
    \item{\code{lifepres}}{Mean life years preserved due to survival for at least 6 months following
PCI; numeric value of either 11.4 or 0.}
    \item{\code{cardbill}}{Cardiac related costs incurred within 6 months of patient's initial PCI;
numeric value in 1998 dollars; costs were truncated by death for the 26 patients with
lifepres == 0.}
    \item{\code{abcix}}{Numeric treatment selection indicator; 0 implies usual PCI care alone; 1
implies usual PCI care deliberately augmented by either planned or rescue treatment
with abciximab.}
    \item{\code{stent}}{Coronary stent deployment; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.}
    \item{\code{height}}{Height in centimeters; numeric integer from 108 to 196.}
    \item{\code{female}}{Female gender; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.}
    \item{\code{diabetic}}{Diabetes mellitus diagnosis; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.}
    \item{\code{acutemi}}{Acute myocardial infarction within the previous 7 days; numeric, with 1
meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.}
    \item{\code{ejecfrac}}{Left ejection fraction; numeric value from 0 percent to 90 percent.}
    \item{\code{ves1proc}}{Number of vessels involved in the patient's initial PCI procedure; numeric
integer from 0 to 5.}
